## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

### What I learned/ How I made it

I have learned about routing and state management a lot in this project. For managing the state i have use the combination of useReducer and useContext. For persisting the data across browser refresh i have used local forage database. I learned about action , loaders , context , reducer. I have made a responsive design supporting all types of devices. The inspiration i took for code was from [david-tajeda](https://davidtejada.dev/), i read his code and that helped me a lot in building this website. I have tried my best to do the best practice. This project took more time than i thought there was a lot of modals and cases that have to be handled.I will be improving this project in future.
